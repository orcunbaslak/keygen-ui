# Keygen UI — Canonical Implementation Plan

This plan consolidates and supersedes: `docs/phase1-implementation-plan.md`, `docs/phase1-completion-summary.md`, `docs/comprehensive-implementation-plan.md`, and `ImplementationPlan.md`. Treat this as the single source of truth for current status and next steps.

## Current Status

- Core features implemented and production-ready:
  - Licenses, Machines, Products, Policies, Users
  - Groups, Entitlements, Webhooks
  - Auth (login/logout), protected routes, sidebar navigation
  - Type-safe API client, consistent error handling, professional UI (shadcn/ui)
- Analytics foundation in place via Request Logs resource (UI work planned)

## Objectives by Phase

### Phase 2 — Releases & Artifacts (P0)
- Releases UI: channels (stable/beta/alpha), semantic versioning, release notes
- Artifacts: upload, platform/arch targeting, download metrics
- Packages/channels: grouping and rollout controls

Deliverables:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/releases/page.tsx`
- `src/components/releases/*` (create/edit/delete/details, artifact upload)
- `src/lib/api/resources/{releases,artifacts,packages}.ts`

### Phase 3 — Analytics & Monitoring (P0)
- Request Logs viewer with filtering, error rate and latency analytics
- Enhanced dashboard widgets: license utilization, activation trends, geo distribution

Deliverables:
- `src/components/analytics/*` (request-logs-viewer, api-usage-dashboard, charts)
- Charting via Recharts (already installed)

### Phase 4 — Security & Admin (P1)
- Token management UI (create, scope, revoke, expiry)
- RBAC enhancements (custom roles, granular permissions)

Deliverables:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/tokens/page.tsx`
- `src/components/tokens/*` (management, create, details, permissions)

### Phase 5 — Bulk Ops & Search (P2)
- CSV/JSON import-export across resources; batch queue with progress
- Global search, advanced filter builders, saved queries

Deliverables:
- `src/components/bulk-operations/*` (imports, exports, queue)
- `src/components/search/*` (global search, filters)

### Phase 6 — UX Enhancements (P2)
- Dark mode, customizable dashboard widgets, keyboard shortcuts
- Data virtualization for large tables, smoother loading states

### Phase 7 — Platform Integrations (P3)
- Webhook Event Explorer (payload inspector, retries, simulation)
- In‑app API docs viewer and Postman export

## Engineering Standards

- Type Safety: strict TS across API/resources/components
- Error Handling: consistent toasts, granular HTTP messages, retry where safe
- Performance: pagination, SWR caching, virtualization for large datasets
- Accessibility: shadcn/ui semantics, keyboard navigation

## Done Definition

- CRUD complete with validation and error states
- Tests added or updated (unit for API utilities, integration where applicable)
- Docs updated (this file + project docs)
- Navigation wired and protected routes enforced

## Milestone Tracking

- P0 (Ship next): Phase 2, Phase 3
- P1 (Next): Token management, RBAC
- P2 (Nice-to-have): Bulk ops, search, UX polish
- P3 (Later): Webhook explorer, API docs viewer

## Notes

- This plan is intentionally compact. For broader system details, see `docs/project-documentation.md`.
